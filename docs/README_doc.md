# README

This readme is here to help updating the documentation for SLAYER PyTorch.

## Install the sphinx tool

Start with sourcing the same virtual environment where you installed SLAYER. Then, install **sphinx** (more documentation can be found [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html)) by running:
```
$ pip install sphinx
```
or with the option -U to install in the user space.

**NB**: it is required to install sphinx in the same virtual environment as slayer to enable it to find the code and do the links in the documentation.

## Update the documentation

If you made any change, you can update the documentation with the following
``` 
$ cd <path_to_slayerPytorch>/docs
$ make html
```
