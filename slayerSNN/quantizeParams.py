class quantizeWeights(torch.autograd.Function):
    '''
    This class provides routine to quantize the weights during forward propagation pipeline.
    The backward propagation pipeline passes the gradient as it it, without any modification.

    Arguments;
        * ``weights``: full precision weight tensor.
        * ``step``: quantization step size. Default: 1

    Usage:

    >>> # Quantize weights in step of 0.5
    >>> stepWeights = quantizeWeights.apply(fullWeights, step=0.5)
